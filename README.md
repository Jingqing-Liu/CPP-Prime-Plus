# C++ Primer Plus, Sixth Edition Study Repository

Welcome to my study repository for the "C++ Primer Plus, Sixth Edition" book. This repository serves as a personal space where I document my learning journey through the book, attempt to solve exercises, and share my solutions.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to read and study the "C++ Primer Plus, Sixth Edition" by Stephen Prata, an authoritative guide on C++ programming. As I progress through the chapters, I'll be attempting to complete the exercises provided in the book and upload my solutions here.

## Goals

- **Learning and Understanding C++:** Deepen my understanding of C++ through systematic study of the book.
- **Exercise Solutions:** Attempt to solve all exercises in the book to the best of my abilities.
- **Continuous Updates:** Keep this repository updated as I progress through the book.

## Repository Structure

Each chapter from the book will have its own directory named `Chapter_X` where `X` represents the chapter number.

## Contributing

While this is a personal study project, I welcome any suggestions or corrections from other readers and C++ enthusiasts. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you notice mistakes or have alternative solutions to the exercises.

## Stay Updated

I plan to keep this repository lively by regularly updating it as I continue my study. You can star or watch this repository to stay updated with my progress.

Thank you for visiting my learning journey with "C++ Primer Plus, Sixth Edition".
